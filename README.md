# Rater
Rater is an iOS app that allows users to rate photos of each other anonymously.

## Installation

First of all you need to run backend server. For that purpose we user golang and postgres.
To run server with docker use these commands.

```
docker-compose up
```

Then go to cmd/main directory 
```
cd cmd/main
```

And compile and run the server

```
go run main.go
```

Server is ready for work. Now you can run xcode and start the app.
